## Description

The goal of this project was to explore genetic algorithms, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Throughout the project, we developed a genetic algorithm and neural network framework that has been used in several other projects. One of the key areas that we fell short of in this project was efficiency, and efficient code was not one of our main concerns as we developed it. We were successful in the goals that we did have though, and we gained a significantly deeper understanding of the concepts we attempted to replicate here. 

## Development

We began development of this project by first making a basic implementation of neural networks. At the time, we did not know the linear algebra necessary to represent neural networks in matrices, and thus used very inefficient iterative techniques for our computations. Despite the inefficiencies, the code did work, and we were able to get the most basic models working on simple problems. Extending this, we used object oriented concepts to structure our genetic algorithm code in a very modular manner, this allowed us to rapidly develop new applications for our models down the line.
